      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
       Medicine Search Engine (MSE) is a web-based platform designed to make finding medicines fast and reliable during emergencies. Pharmacists can upload their medicine inventory into the system using a secure admin panel. Each entry includes details such as medicine name, brand, quantity and availability status. This data is stored in a MongoDB database, making it easy to update and manage in real time.

On the user side, customers can search for medicines by name and instantly view which nearby pharmacies have them in stock. The system retrieves data dynamically from the database and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS and Flask. This ensures users can quickly find what they need without manually calling multiple pharmacies.
